            How This All Started
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-5 font-work-sans text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-gray-700">
            I built my first website around 2003 using GeoCities to host web
            pages built purely with HTML. A couple of years later, I was
            creating custom MySpace pages for myself &amp; a few friends with
            CSS.
          </p>
          <p className="font-work-sans text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-gray-700">
            At the time I didn't realize the opportunities available in web
            development, and in college I pursued my interests in writing and
            philosophy, earning my Bachelor of Arts as a double major in English
            Literature &amp; Philosophy from the University of Colorado,
            Colorado Springs. After looking for ways to make a living from
            writing, I discovered the world of content marketing, writing blogs
            and other content for websites with a focus on burgeoning software
            technology including blockchain.

            Moving into Digital Marketing
          </h3>
          <p className="font-work-sans text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-gray-700">
            After discovering the world of digital marketing as a content
            writer, I became interested in the world of SEO, joining the team at
            one of the leading digital marketing firms in the United States,
            SocialSEO. This gave me the opportunity to apply my writing skills
            and many other SEO tactics every day working with a range of
            businesses, from small local companies to ecommerce brands to large
            corporate enterprises and SaaS companies.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 font-work-sans text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-gray-700">
            Working in SEO also reignited my passion for web development, and I
            returned to school to attend University of Denver's coding bootcamp,
            which is an intensive full stack web development program focused on
            JavaScript development using the MERN stack.

          </h3>
          <p className="font-work-sans text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-gray-700">
            Upon graduating from University of Denver, I continued improving my
            knowledge and skills in SEO with a focus on SEO for React web
            applications and organic ecommerce growth. Not satisfied with
            improving sites built by others, I made the decision to move into
            software full time. Now I work as a{' '}
