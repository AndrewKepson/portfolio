        A Headless WordPress Developer <wbr /> Your Marketing Team Will Love

        Many business owners invest in high-quality websites, realizing the
        importance of having a website for building a business in the
        twenty-first century. However, most developers do not think like
        marketers, prioritizing the wrong things that keep you from making the
        most money as quickly as possible.

      <p className="mt-6 max-w-3xl font-work-sans text-xl text-gray-900">
        With years of experience working in digital marketing, I think like a
        marketer and build SEO-ready headless WordPress websites that are
        marketing platforms ready to be managed by your marketing team or
        content manager seamlessly from day one. Marketers love working with me
        because I understand their needs and set them up for success in reaching
        your business goals.
