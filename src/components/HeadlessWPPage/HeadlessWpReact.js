            Ever since Facebook created React and released it to the world in
            2014, it has quickly become a popular choice for web developers and
            the companies they work for to build beautiful, fast, and responsive
            websites and user interfaces. React{' '}

              Gatsby is a React framework. This means it is built on top of
              React, providing all of the functionality and quickness you expect
              from a React application, with additional features designed to
              enhance the development experience when building websites and to
              make them even faster and more efficient, especially with headless
              WordPress. As a headless WordPress developer, I love using{' '}
