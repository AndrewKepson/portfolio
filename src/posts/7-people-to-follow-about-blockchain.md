As interest in Blockchain and its related technology continues to grow and more professionals enter the industry, which is rapidly becoming more complex and multifaceted, most people wonder where to start. Perhaps you have just a passing interest in the subject and want to spice up your Twitter feed with light information, or maybe you‚Äôre a fanatic who wants to confirm that you‚Äôre in on the latest Blockchain news.<br><br>

Either way, here are 7 respected industry professionals who are active on social media and will enrich your understanding of Blockchain and cryptocurrency in different ways:<br><br>

<h3 class="text-gray-600 text-4xl">Brian Armstrong</h3><br>

Brian Armstrong is the Co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, the hugely popular online currency exchange. Going into 2020, Coinbase is available in 33 countries, where users can use their fiat currency to purchase a wide array of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Armstrong Co-founded GiveCrypto, a non-profit that allows people to donate cryptocurrency to help people in need.<br><br>

While his professional achievements alone make Armstrong someone to keep an eye on, he is also a Blogger on <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://medium.com/@barmstrong" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Medium</a>, a contributor to <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://nakamoto.com/crypto-in-the-2020s/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nakamoto</a>, and his <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter feed</a> is an excellent place to keep up to date on the latest news in cryptocurrency.<br><br>

<h3 class="text-gray-600 text-4xl">Anthony Pompliano</h3><br>

A veteran of the United States Army, Anthony Pompliano served in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and by 2014 he went on to work for social media household names Facebook and Snapchat, eventually going on to Co-found investment firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets in 2018.<br><br>

Pompliano is well respected in the Blockchain world for his newsletter, Off the Chain, a daily email that he sends to investors about Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, providing his customers with the most up to date information available. While a full subscription to Off the Chain is paid, he does occasionally write posts that are free and open to the public, and his Twitter feed is updated frequently.<br><br>

While her written content and <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ted Talk</a> should be on anyone‚Äôs list to consume, I want to highlight her Podcasts for those who prefer listening over reading. She operates two Podcasts: <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/category/unchained/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Unchained</a>, and <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/category/unconfirmed/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Unconfirmed</a>. The former is an hour long deep dive into a wide variety of topics in the Blockchain space, and the latter is a twenty minute weekly recap on the most important and relevant trends in Blockchain. Both are excellent and available on their website as well as all major streaming services.<br><br>

<h3 class="text-gray-600 text-4xl">Sasha Backsht</h3><br>

Sasha Backsht has been involved in tech since the 1990s, building a reputation as a business analyst and team manager, and in 2017 he became the Chief Operating Officer of <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://blockgeeks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Blockgeeks</a>, which aims to be the world‚Äôs leading Blockchain online education sources.<br><br>

<h3 class="text-gray-600 text-4xl">Vitalik Buterin</h3><br>

Russian born Vitaly Dmitriyevich ‚ÄúVitalik‚Äù Buterin began his career in Blockchain as a blogger, and at the end of 2011 co-founded Bitcoin Magazine. However, Buterin is famous for his other career as the inventor and co-founder of **Etherium**, a Blockchain designed to allow applications to be built using scripting, which was not feasible on the Bitcoin Blockchain.<br><br>

While Etherium has been a source of controversy for many in the Blockchain community, it is indisputable that Buterin is a Blockchain visionary, and at only 25 years old it is expected that he has many more contributions to make to its development. Buterin is very active on <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, often sharing his thoughts about current events and happenings in the Blockchain community. He is also a contributor to <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nakamoto</a>.<br><br>

<h3 class="text-gray-600 text-4xl">Nick Szabo</h3><br>

There is no greater living legend in the Blockchain industry than Nick Szabo. Best known for his work as a cryptographer, Szabo is a computer scientist by training, and way back in 1998 he attempted to create the first cryptocurrency, Bit Gold.<br><br>

When Bitcoin came onto the scene in 2009, it was created anonymously, the white paper written by a mysterious individual who wrote under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. While Szabo has vehemently denied it, many people have suspected that Szabo is the true architect of Bitcoin.<br><br>

Regardless, Nick Szabo‚Äôs work has been hugely influential to the Blockchain community. His <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, while not frequently updated in the past few years, contains a gold mine of his knowledge on various subjects, and he maintains an active presence on <a class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-400" href="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.<br><br>

<div class="mx-12 flex flex-row justify-center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Bitcoin isn&#39;t robust than it isn&#39;t robust, right? It&#39;s a great point but the security of Bitcoin shouldn&#39;t be dependent on unappealing block amounts, correct?</p>&mdash; Ryan Calder (@RyanCCalder) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanCCalder/status/1169852257480822784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2019</a></blockquote> </div><br>
